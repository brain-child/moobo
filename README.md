### Credits

Moobo is developed after a concept by [Heru Setiawan](https://hrstwn.github.io/). Heru Setiawan is an illustrator who came up with the idea of the app. The original mockup can be found on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/elementaryos/comments/kg5uiw/moobo_is_a_moodboarding_and_notetaking_app/).
